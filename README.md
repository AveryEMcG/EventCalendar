# EventCalendar
 A calendar to view Scheduled Events



Plan:
Front end: react JS
Back end: FAST API
Data: Sqlite




Implement a server-side application and simple userinterface for creating and viewing scheduled
events, using Python as the server-side technology. You may use the technology of your choice forthe
UI.

* Scheduled events must have a name and a specific start time and duration
* Scheduled events may occur once, or may repeat weekly at the same time on one or more specific
days of the week as specified by the user. For example, a user may choose to schedule an event
occur at the same time every Monday and Wednesday.

* No more than one event may be scheduled to occur at a given day and time.
* The UI must be compatible with current browser versions of at least Chrome and Firefox.
* The UI must allow the userto view the set of previously scheduled events and to add a new event.
* The application must include a README with instructions for building and running the application
* There is no requirement for you to containerize your submission. However, you may optionally
Dockerize your submission; please do not use any other containerization technology.
* Clearly state all of the assumptions you made in completing the application
* Submit your exercise response by providing the URL to a public Github repositorycd
